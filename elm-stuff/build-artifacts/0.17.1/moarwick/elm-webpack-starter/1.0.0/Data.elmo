(You can make changes to your paragraph by updating your answers above.):  \n\n1. Read the paragraph out loud. This can help you pick up on anything that sounds repetitive, awkward, or choppy.\n\n2. Ask yourself the following questions about the content and flow:\n  * What should I add?\n  * What should I take out? \n  * What should I move?\n  * Is the paragraph clear and easy to follow?\n  * Are there transitions between ideas? (e.g., Have I used words such as \"Firstly,\" \"Secondly,\" \"Thirdly,\" \"Finally,\" \"Thus,\" \"Therefore,\" and so on?)  \n\n3. Ask yourself the following questions about the style and format:\n  - Is the first line of the paragraph indented?\n  - Is the paragraph complete (correctly structured)? \n  - Are all of the sentences complete?\n  - Does each sentence begin with a capital letter?    \n  - Does each sentence end with a punctuation mark?\n  - Is each sentence free of spelling and grammatical errors?\n  ';
